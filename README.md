# pcb_collaboration_repo
This is to collaboration with student for AI building project

The main aim of this project is to build AI agent/tool to identify the pcb components like capacitor, resister, transister, opamp, diod, ICs etc.
The second aim is to detect the fault/defect in the pcb picture and describe about what type of fault it is.
The final goal is detection, identification, description should work realtime with video/camera.
